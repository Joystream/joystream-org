  ### FAILURE IDENTIFIED

  On Friday the 29th of March, the Sparta network went down due to a 
  [known bug in substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/2130) 
  that we had not pulled down before release. 
  
  More details can be found in this [blog post](https://blog.joystream.org/sparta-sacked/).

    <p>
      <strong>
        Sparta was a prominent city-state in Ancient Greece.
      </strong>
       In addition to its military might, it was also unique both for its time and compared to its greek rivals due its defined social system and constitution.
      <br />
      <br />
      We chose the name Sparta due to it's historical significance in the path towards democracy and rule of law, however draconian by modern standard.
