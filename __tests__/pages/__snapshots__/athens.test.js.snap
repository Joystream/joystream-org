        <strong>
          In Greek mythology, a little owl (Athene noctua)
        </strong>
         traditionally represents or accompanies Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom. Because of such association, the bird — often referred to as the "owl of Athena" — has been used as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, perspicacity and erudition throughout the Western world.

    <p>
      <strong>
        Athens is the capital of Greece.
      </strong>
       IIt was also at the heart of Ancient Greece, a powerful civilisation and empire. The city is still dominated by 5th-century BC landmarks, including the Acropolis, a hilltop citadel topped with ancient buildings like the colonnaded Parthenon temple.
      <br />
      <br />
      We chose the name Athens as, like our previous testnets, Mesopotamia and Sparta, the ancient Athens' historical significance in the development towards modern democracy and the rule of law.
