    and participates in the consensus process for committing new block to the chain.
    This role has a purpose very similar to the miners in the Bitcoin blockchain.

Anyone can contribute in the same mode as any of these possible contributor functions, as all the platform source assets are open source and developed in the open. Being a Builder means that one has some scope of responsibility in ongoing efforts, and that one has some predefined reward scheme associated with this responsibility.
