          General rules for motion can be described with a few simple principles: Smooth transitions, dynamic but fluid
          motion and good amount of easing at the keyframes. This combination should provide a consistent and flexible
          animation style to cover most of the use cases.

            Guides shouldnâ€™t be by no means limiting, they should only serve a purpose of providing consistency for
            animations.
