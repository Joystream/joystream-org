Offering an excellent experience for developer to build apps, and not just use Atlas off-the shelf, will require a significant investment in building out the SDK. This milestone has as a goal to extract the core of key existing applications, like Atlas and Pioneer, and then to synthesize it all into a new core developer experience, with a suite of excellent tutorials, documentation, examples and also active outreach."

As it stands, only a single version of each media asset is represented in our metadata standards and backend node software. This means have now way to represent a broad range of encodings and resolutions for media assets, let alone produce all of these. Introducing server-side transcoding in Orion will unlock this, and many other future benefits that come from server-side post-processing (thumbnail extractions, auto-subtitling, etc.). It will also unlock the ability to do adaptive streaming, where a user with a dynamic connection can more quickly see asset resolve and play, and also be able to watch videos under suboptimal circumstances."

Key product experiences like home screens, feeds and related content, all depend on having modern Machine learning based content recommendation system. Currently Orion has no infrastructure to produce or serve such recommendations, and app recommendations are being done entirely client-side. The goal of this milestone is to ship the first recommendation capability in Orion, to make Joystream apps much more."
