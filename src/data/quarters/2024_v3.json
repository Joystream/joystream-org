Introducing server-side transcoding in Orion will unlock this, and many other future benefits that come from server-side post-processing (thumbnail extractions, auto-subtitling, etc.). It will also unlock the ability to do adaptive streaming, where a user with a dynamic connection can more quickly see asset resolve and play, and also be able to watch videos under suboptimal circumstances."
